# Not So Fast

Low-key food tracking.

Fasting for slackers.

Non-committally track what you eat. The goal is to increase intervals between
meals.

## UI

* Left – Date – Right
* Circle with meals
* Add meal
* History
* 4 circles for each ingredient
* Icons for each size or emoji if it's in title
* Draw icons in PaintCode

## Technology

* SQLite via https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift
* That's it!

(but I think I'll use Core Data instead for UI sync primarily)

## Process

* Create data model
* Implement simple UI
* Make a study for fancier UI
* Implement fancy UI
* Publish on the App Store

## Features

* See food “dots“ for the past 24 hours with intervals.
* Record food: amount and type.
* Amount: Bite, Cup, Plate, Bucket.
* Type: Fast Carbs, Slow Carbs, Protein, Fat.
* Title: Emoji (choose from list).
* Edit to adjust time.
* Switch dates forward and back.
* Summary for today displayed when not adding food.
* The app is localized!
* That's it!

## Money

* Maybe pay to enable iCloud sharing?
* Patronage/donation?
